# 🔐 VPN Hands-on Lab — Practical Cybersecurity Task

## 📌 Task Overview
This mini project demonstrates how to set up and use a VPN to understand how virtual private networks protect online privacy, encrypt internet traffic, and mask your real IP address.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Gain practical experience connecting to a VPN.
- Verify how IP masking works.
- Understand how VPN encryption secures data in transit.
- Evaluate VPN benefits and limitations.

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. Chose a reputable free VPN (e.g., ProtonVPN Free).
2. Signed up for an account and verified email.
3. Downloaded and installed the official VPN client.
4. Connected to a VPN server (chose a nearby country for better speed).
5. Verified my public IP address changed using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://www.whatismyipaddress.com).
6. Browsed secure websites to confirm traffic was encrypted through the VPN tunnel.
7. Disconnected the VPN and noted the real IP address was restored.
8. Compared browsing speed with and without VPN connection.
9. Researched VPN protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2), no-logs policies, and kill switch features.
10. Wrote a short summary on VPN benefits and limitations.

## 📊 Outcome

- Successfully hid real IP address and tunneled traffic through an encrypted channel.
- Understood how VPNs protect privacy on public Wi-Fi.
- Identified how free VPNs can have speed limits, data caps, and fewer server options.

---

## 📝 Key Learnings

- **Benefits:** IP masking, encrypted traffic, protection on untrusted networks.
- **Limitations:** Not foolproof; VPNs do not block phishing or malware, some sites may block VPN IPs, free VPNs can be slower.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
A VPN is a vital layer of privacy and security — but it must be used responsibly along with strong passwords, safe browsing, and up-to-date security tools.
